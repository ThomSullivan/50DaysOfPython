# Day 49: Create a Database
# For this challenge, you are going to create a database using 
# Pythonâ€™s SQLite. You will import SQLite into your script. 
# Create a database called movies.db. In that database, you are 
# going to create a table called movies. In that table, you are 
# going to save the following movies:
# year      title       genre
# 2009      Brothers    Drama
# 2002      Spider Man  Sci-fi
# 2009      WatchMen    Drama
# 2010      Inception   Sci-fi
# 2009      Avatar      Fantasy
# a) Once you create a table, run a SQL query to see all the 
# movies in your table.
# b) Run another SQL query to select only the movie Brothers 
# from the list.
# c) Run another SQL query to select all movies that were 
# released in 2009 from your table.
# d) Run another query to select movies in the fantasy and 
# drama genre.
# e) Run a query to delete all the contents of your table
