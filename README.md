Work with the book 50 Days of Python
This is an undertaking to sharpen skills and to increase activity levels on github. I will do one challenge from the book in this repo a day. 
Day 8: Decided to write Pytest tests for code written to complete daily challenges. Also added requirements since the use of Pytest has introduced dependencies.
