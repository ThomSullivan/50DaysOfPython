Work with the book 50 Days of Python
I found someone talking about the book, [50 Days of Python](https://benjaminb.gumroad.com/l/zybjn) by Benjamin Bennett Alexander, in this [group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/25827/) a few months ago and decided to check it out.
After completing all 50 days of this book I am glad that I started. This was an insightful exercise that I would wager all can learn something from.  Completing all the challenges requires the use of several different modules.  The final day is a great finale for the exercise, and requires the creation of a simple Flask project.

Modules you get practice with during the 50 days of challenges

- Flask 
- sqlite3
- json
- pandas
- requests
- csv
- timeit
- re
- statistics
- random
- emoji
- datetime
- math

Bonus modules

[Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/)

 – Since I hear that testing is a crucial part of coding…. I chose to add tests for as many of the challenges as I could during the 50 days. I was able to write tests for 80/83 challenges. Some were easy, some were not.(Wait until you get to day 43, if you decide to add this dimension to the exercise.)  
[Pyinputplus](https://pypi.org/project/PyInputPlus/)

- There is a fair amount of user input involed during the 50 days. This module has a lot to offer when dealing with error handling associated with unexpected user inputs. When used, input validation is easily implemented and users are prompted again when an invalid input is encountered. Pyinputplus will also display a hint to the user about the expected input format.
