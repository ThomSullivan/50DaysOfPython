#       Day 1: Division and Square-root
# Write a function called divide_or_square that takes one 
# argument (a number), and returns the square root of the number 
# if it is divisible by 5, returns its remainder if it is not divisible by 
# 5. For example, if you pass 10 as an argument, then your function 
# should return 3.16 as the square root.

#       Extra Challenge: Longest Value
# Write a function called longest_value that takes a dictionary 
# as an argument and returns the first longest value of the 
# dictionary. For example, the following dictionary should return 
# â€“ apple as the longest value.
fruits = {'fruit': 'apple', 'color': 'green'}
